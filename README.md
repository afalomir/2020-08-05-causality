This is a repository of relevant files for the research and computation on causality in health and related fields.
This repository contains the ipynb (jupyter notebook files) and data sets for learning and teaching about causal inference and specifically, how to:

- Think about causal inference from traditional perspectives (internal validity and Hill's criteria)
- Think about causal inference from the perspective of counterfactual theories of causation (refer to Hernan and Robins' work)
- Use Directed Acyclic graphs to explore causal inference (both counterfactual theories and otherwise)
- Use inverse probability weighting to weight observations (IP weighting: see work by Hernan et al)
- Use standardisation to weight participants or observations for counterfactual theories of causation (see Hernan et al and Pearl)
- Use instrumental variables 
- Use structural equation modelling to study counterfactual theories of causation
